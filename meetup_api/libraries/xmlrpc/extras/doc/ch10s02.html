      dawn of XML and is described only in natural language. Attempts have
      been made to "reverse specify" it with DTD or XSD, with little success.
      Both definition languages are in fact too limited in their capability of
      expressing valid xml constructs to capture in a complete and correct
      fashion the XMLRPC semantics (see
      http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/chapters/ch02s05.html for more
      details. Suffice to say that XSD does not allow to specify two
      consecutive xml elements with the same name but of different types, such
      as the faultCode and faultReason response members happen to be).</p><p>The RELAX-NG definition language on the other hand has been found
      capable enough to fully describe XMLRPC, and the schema that is part of
      this distribution can be used to validate any XMLRPC request or response
      conforming to the spec. IT IS NOT AUTHORITATIVE because the XMLRPC
      specification is copyright by Dave Winer, and he seems to have lost
      interest in any further development of the protocol, but it should be
      considered accurate and production ready (if you find any bugs, please
      let the authors know, using the <a class="ulink" href="???" target="_top">project's web
      site</a>).</p><p>This situation is very unfortunate, since WSDL has emerged as a
      widely accepted web services standard, and a plethora of tools exist to
      parse existing WSDL files and automatically generate code stubs or
      generate WSDL definitions from existing code. If a WSDL representation
      of XMLRPC webservices could be generated, the net result would be
      greatly inreased interoperability between SOAP clients and toolkits and
      XMLRPC server implementations.</p><p>Even though the apparent goal of the WSDL language design was to
      allow description of every possible message exchange, using every
      conceivable xml serialization over any transport (and a lot of the
      redundancy, verbosity and complication of the language are direct
      consequence of the flexibility sought), existing implementations de
      facto only support the SOAP binding for webservices, and XSD as language
      definition schema. RELAX-NG, while nominally accepted, has yet to find
      widespread usage in webservices toolkits. This leaves us with
      almost-bot-not-quite interoperable solutions.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch10.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch10.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch11.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 10. WSDL package </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 11. XMLRPC extension API package</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
