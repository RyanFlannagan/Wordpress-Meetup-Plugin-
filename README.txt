WP Meetup fetches event information from Meetup.com and creates posts for each event.

== Description ==

WP Meetup fetches event information from Meetup.com and creates posts for each event.  Additionally, WP Meetup provides an event calendar for displaying upcoming events either on a page or as a widget.

Uses the [Meetup PHP API](https://github.com/wizonesolutions/meetup_api) developed by wizonesolutions.
